# Pre-Intrusion Objectives

This section contains detections that surface **observable behaviors** which may support intrusion hypotheses but **do not independently establish attacker intent, access, or success**.

Detections in this category are intentionally scoped to:
- Highlight ambiguous or early indicators
- Avoid premature ATT&CK mapping
- Require analyst judgment and additional correlation

These detections are **not sufficient on their own** to justify incident declaration or containment actions. They exist to inform investigation, not determine disposition.

When correlated with stronger signals, Pre-Intrusion detections may contribute to higher-confidence attacker objective assessments.
