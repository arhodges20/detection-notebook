# Attacker Objective: Credential Access

## Goal
Detect behavior associated with an adversary attempting to obtain credentials on Windows endpoints and/or in cloud identity systems.

## Why this matters
Credential theft is a common pivot point that enables privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, and data access.

## What’s included
- Threat model and ATT&CK mapping
- Coverage tracking (what is detected vs. gaps)
- Detections (initial set)
